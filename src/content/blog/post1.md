Our findings that risk in traffic images can be predicted using GPT-4V with a high degree of accuracy have been published in Royal Society Open Science.

We also show that phrasing prompts in slightly different ways improves the accuracy of the results. For instance, combining prompts like "please rate the risk in this image" and "how safe would you feel in this situation" gives better results than repeating either prompt alone. This approach mirrors how humans interpret questions differently.
