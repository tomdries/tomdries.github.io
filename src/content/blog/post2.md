Trucks are disproportionately involved in fatal traffic accidents and contribute significantly to CO₂ emissions.

Using driving data from 180 truck drivers collected over a 2-year period, we predicted damage incidents, traffic fines, and fuel consumption.

We showed that fines and damage incidents could be predicted based on the number of harsh braking events per hour of driving, while fuel consumption was predicted by engine torque exceedances.

Contributing factors could partially be beyond the driver’s immediate control. For instance, drivers who are required to drive in urban areas may be expected to have more damage and brake harshly more often.

Studies like these can be important for our research partners ABW, who, as an insurance company, benefit from reduced costs and NEXTdriver, who provide technology to coach truck drivers on driving style.

The full study was published today in [Transportation Research Record](https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981231211897) and will be a chapter of my PhD thesis, in which I explore how we can use data to make humans better drivers. The paper was co-authored with Dimitra Dodou, Dick de Waard and Joost de Winter.
